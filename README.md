# Medical-Devices-Security
Research project exploring cybersecurity vulnerabilities in medical devices using honeypot experiments. Includes case studies, findings on opportunistic attacks, FDA/industry responses, and future solutions such as AI anomaly detection and blockchain for secure data.
# 🔒 Medical Devices: Pwnage and Honeypots  
**Exploring Healthcare Security Vulnerabilities**  

This project investigates **cybersecurity risks in internet-connected medical devices** through **honeypot experiments** and literature review. With the rapid adoption of **IoT-enabled healthcare**, patient safety and data security face increasing threats.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
- **Problem**: Medical devices (defibrillators, MRI machines, insulin pumps, etc.) are increasingly targeted by attackers.  
- **Goal**: Study vulnerabilities, analyze attacker behavior, and propose mitigation strategies.  
- **Method**: Deployed **honeypots** emulating medical devices and tracked malicious interactions.  

---

## 🚨 Key Findings  
- **55,000 successful logins** recorded on honeypots.  
- Many attackers were opportunistic (generic exploits) rather than targeted healthcare-specific.  
- Some devices attempted connections to **Command-and-Control (C2) servers**.  
- Revealed **critical patient safety implications** in the event of compromised devices.
